## WorkPlan: Test Boundary Mocks

Provide reusable test doubles for external boundaries shared by client and server tests.

### WorkTopic: Cross-runtime test boundaries

Inventory existing test doubles and reuse or add suitable fakes/mocks for filesystem and HTTP boundaries that work in both client and server test suites.

#### WorkTask: Create or reuse filesystem and HTTP test doubles

**Status:** Pending

Inspect existing filesystem and HTTP test mocks/fakes. Reuse or create reusable test doubles that can be used in both client and server tests, without introducing real filesystem writes or network I/O in tests.
